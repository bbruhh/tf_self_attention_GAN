Tensorflow implementation of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with spectral normalization and self-attention (SA) layer.

Note: this implementation was done with Google's Colab environment which allows for FREE-GPU acceleration up to 12-hours.

The dataset used is the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset which consists of over 200k images of celebrities with 40 binary attribute annotations (although the attribute annotations were not used during training)
